/* hi there i am a student of btech 3rd sem studiying in manav ranchna international institute of research and studies i am here to show you the quiz game done by c++ langugage,here what we 
need is that we have to implement the code by using string,vector and ater implement there things the output what we need is firstry we write the option and the compilere compiles the code
and check that whether it is correct or not*/
