OVERVIEW Of PROJECt

1. Designing the Game
Objective: The quiz game should present multiple-choice questions to the player, allow them to select an answer, and provide feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect.

2. Components of the Game
a. Questions and Answers

Store questions and corresponding answers in data structures (e.g., arrays, vectors, or structs).
b. User Interface

Use cout and cin for text-based interaction.
Display questions and multiple-choice options.
Prompt the user for input and validate their choice.
c. Game Logic

Randomly select questions from the question bank.
Compare the user's input with the correct answer and update the score accordingly.
Track the number of correct and incorrect answers.
d. Flow Control

Implement a loop to continue presenting questions until all questions are answered or a set limit is reached.
Provide an option to replay or quit the game after completion.
3. Implementation Steps
a. Data Representation:

Define a data structure for questions and answers. For example, you could use a struct or a class to represent each question with its options and correct answer.
b. User Interaction:

Use cout to display questions and options.
Use cin to get user input and validate it (ensure it's within the valid range of options).
c. Game Logic:

Randomly select questions from your collection.
Compare the user's choice with the correct answer.
Keep track of scores and display them at the end of the quiz.
d. Control Flow:

Implement a loop to iterate through each question.
Provide an option to end the quiz or replay it.
